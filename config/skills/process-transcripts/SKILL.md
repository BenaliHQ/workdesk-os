name: process-transcripts
description: Process unprocessed transcripts in system/intake/ into atlas/meetings, atlas/decisions, atlas/people updates, and gtd/inbox proposals. Uses Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite as the structured extractor (~$0.002/transcript, 4s latency) and Claude for vault integration (wikilink resolution, matching cross-updates, file ops, verification). Operator-confirmed per transcript. Honors matching, action-item ownership, source-documentation, and the source-processing-pattern intake → process → archive flow.

# /process-transcripts

Move raw transcripts through the extraction pipeline into structured vault notes. Operator confirms each transcript before processing. Never auto-process in the background.

## Architecture

Two-model pipeline. Gemini does cheap structured extraction; Claude does the vault discipline work that Gemini can't.

```
intake/{slug}.md (verbatim)
        │
        ▼  config/scripts/extract-transcript-gemini.sh
Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite (~$0.002, ~4s)
        │  strict JSON schema (.claude/skills/process-transcripts/schema.json)
        │
        ▼  Claude (Opus or Sonnet via subagent)
   • Validate JSON
   • Resolve names → wikilinks (Glob over atlas/people/)
   • Network-scope filter for person notes
   • Write atlas/meetings/{slug}.md
   • Apply matching cross-updates
   • Route action items by owner_category
   • Move intake → transcripts/
   • check-wikilinks.sh on every touched file
```

The Gemini prompt + JSON schema live next to this file:
- [`prompt.txt`](prompt.txt)
- [`schema.json`](schema.json)

Both are versioned with the skill so changes are auditable.

## Invocation

- `/process-transcripts` — interactive, one transcript at a time
- `/process-transcripts {path}` — process a specific transcript
- `/process-transcripts --all` — process every unprocessed transcript without per-file confirmation (use sparingly)

## Source location

Per [[../../rules/source-processing-pattern]], unprocessed transcripts live in `system/intake/`. Processed transcripts get moved to `system/transcripts/` (the archive) only after every downstream artifact is produced AND verified. Archive location alone is not completion evidence. Before retrying an archived source, reconcile its stable source identity, `processed-into` outputs and verification result. Resume only missing work; preserve existing verified notes and commitments. Do not create duplicates.

## Phases (per transcript)

### 1. Pre-flight

Read the transcript's frontmatter. Verify:
- `processed: false`
- `source-kind: transcript`
- `source-format` is one of: `granola-public-api`, `google-meet-transcript`, `gemini-meet-transcript`

If `processed: true`, verify referenced outputs before skipping. Missing or contradictory completion evidence needs reconciliation, not a duplicate extraction.

Separate people merely mentioned from attendees; preserve tentative commercial terms as proposals. An empty recording or voicemail receives an explicit no-content disposition with source provenance, not an invented meeting or commitment. Review relevant recorded learnings before processing.

Pre-load vault context that downstream phases need (do this BEFORE the Gemini call so the wikilink resolution work in Phase 3 is fast):
- Glob `atlas/people/*.md` — list of person notes for wikilink resolution
- If meeting title or attendees match a known client, read `atlas/clients/{slug}/_brief.md` and `_status.md`
- If the meeting title matches a project, read its `_brief.md` and `_status.md`
- Recent `atlas/decisions/` (last 30 days) — for contradiction detection

### 2. Gemini extraction

Run the extraction script, capturing to a **unique** temp file (never a shared fixed path like `/tmp/extraction.json` — under Parallel backlog mode below, concurrent agents would clobber each other):

```bash
EXTRACT_JSON=$(mktemp /tmp/extraction-XXXXXX.json)
bash config/scripts/extract-transcript-gemini.sh {transcript-path} > "$EXTRACT_JSON"
```

The script:
- Reads the prompt from `.claude/skills/process-transcripts/prompt.txt`
- Reads the schema from `.claude/skills/process-transcripts/schema.json`
- Calls Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite with `responseMimeType: application/json` + `responseSchema`
- Validates JSON parse
- Emits token usage to stderr, JSON to stdout

**On failure** (exit non-zero), see § Failure fallback below.

### 3. Mid-ingest checkpoint (high-stakes only)

If ANY of these apply, pause and present the Gemini-extracted summary + action item routing to the operator for confirmation BEFORE writing anything:

- Transcript title contains `[HIGH STAKES]` or `[CONFIDENTIAL]`
- Operator flagged it ahead of time
- Gemini returned `"sensitive": true`
- Gemini returned `"speaker_resolution_confidence": "low"`

For routine transcripts (Google Meet + Gemini high-confidence, work topics, sensitive=false), skip the checkpoint.

### 4. Wikilink resolution + vault-fit

Take the extracted JSON and convert names → wikilinks:

- For each name in `attendees_present`, `decisions[].made_by`, `action_items[].owner`, `people_observations[].person`: check if `atlas/people/{slug}.md` exists.
  - Exists → use `[[slug]]`
  - Doesn't exist → use plain text first-name (per [[../../rules/no-fabrication]] — never guess a last name). Note in step 5 for person-note proposal evaluation.

- For project mentions or client mentions: same pattern. Use existing wikilinks where they resolve; plain text otherwise.

**Confidence-driven attribution:**

| `speaker_resolution_confidence` | What to write in the meeting note |
|---|---|
| `high` | Names directly as quoted, with wikilinks where available |
| `partial` | Names with `(inferred)` marker if name didn't appear literally in the transcript text. Create a `[REVIEW]` inbox item proposing the meeting note for operator double-check. |
| `low` | Keep diarization labels (`Speaker A`, `Speaker B`); create a `[REVIEW]` flagging the gap |

> [!warning] Diarized sources: Gemini's speaker mapping is a hypothesis, not ground truth
> On diarization-labeled transcripts (`source-format: granola-public-api`, or any source with `Speaker A/B` labels), Gemini's diarization-to-identity mapping is unreliable — a 40-transcript backlog run (2026-07-07) found it wrong or fully inverted on 3 of 4 substantive phone calls, including one where Gemini self-reported `high` confidence over utterance-level misattribution. For diarized sources: cap the effective `speaker_resolution_confidence` at `partial` regardless of what Gemini self-reports, and verify identity against vault cross-references (prior meeting notes with the same person, direct self-identifications in the verbatim, client status logs) before writing names. Name-resolved sources (Google Meet, Gemini Docs) don't need this cap.

### 5. Write the meeting note

`atlas/meetings/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{topic-slug}.md` per [[../../objects/meeting]]. Build from the extracted JSON:

Required body sections (always present):
- **Summary** — Gemini's `summary` field
- **Key Topics** — Gemini's `key_topics[]`
- **Decisions** — Gemini's `decisions[]` (inline routine ones; durable ones get standalone notes per step 6)
- **Action Items** — Gemini's `action_items[]` (full record; owner-based routing happens in step 7)
- **Source** — wikilink back to the intake transcript file

Optional sections (only when Gemini's arrays are non-empty):
- **Key Quotes** — `key_quotes[]`
- **People Observations** — `people_observations[]`
- **Open Questions** — `open_questions[]`

Frontmatter:
- `date:` is the meeting occurrence date supported by source metadata or explicit confirmation, never today's processing date or an import timestamp. If absent, leave it unknown and record the missing context. A full meeting record cannot be finalized until required context is resolved; a scoped extraction may return the requested known facts without inventing extra metadata or claiming full processing completion. Do not fabricate a date-based filename for an undated source.
- `created:` and `last_updated:` describe note creation/editing, separate from meeting occurrence.
- `author:` names the actual verified authoring agent/runtime. Include the operator as an attendee only when their presence is supported by the source; importing a recording does not establish attendance.
- `sensitive: true` if Gemini flagged it (see [[../../objects/meeting]] § Confidentiality)
- `attendees:` from `attendees_present[]` (wikilinks where they resolve, plain text otherwise)
- `transcript:` wikilink to the intake source

### 6. Apply matching

Update each touched entity in the same pass per [[../../rules/matching]]:

- **Attendees with vault notes** — add substantive new context from `people_observations[]` with inline footnote citation to the meeting note. For attendees without a vault note, decide per the network-scope filter in [[../../objects/person]]:
  - Person is in the operator's direct network and meets ≥3-mention threshold → propose `[REVIEW]` for person note creation
  - Person is a clients'-client / homeowner / tertiary mention → mention by name in the meeting body; do NOT propose a person note
- **Decisions** — durable decisions (`durability: "durable"` from Gemini) get standalone `atlas/decisions/{date}-{slug}.md` notes. Routine ones stay inline.
- **Client / business `_status.md`** — substantive new context warrants an update.

### 7. Route action items by ownership

Use Gemini's `owner_category` enum:

| `owner_category` | Where it goes |
|---|---|
| `operator` | `gtd/inbox/[ACTION] {slug}.md` — one file per commitment, no cap. This is the operator's own work; the inbox is where they clarify it out to `actions/next/` or a project. |
| `team` + `blocks_operator: true` | `gtd/actions/waiting/[WAITING] {slug}.md` — the operator is genuinely blocked on this delegated item. Keep waiting/ sparse: only hard blockers on the operator's forward progress qualify. Also stays inline on the meeting note. |
| `team` + `blocks_operator: false` (default) | **Inline on the meeting note only. Do NOT create an inbox entry.** Delegated team work is the team's to track, not the operator's GTD surface. The meeting note is the record. |
| `client_team` | Stays inline in the meeting note's `## Action Items` section. If material, also add to the client's `_status.md` under a "client-side open items" / equivalent section. **Do NOT create inbox entries.** |
| `client_client` | Inline only; no inbox, no client status. |
| `unknown` | Inline + create a `[QUESTION]` inbox item asking the operator to clarify ownership |

The meeting note's `## Action Items` section captures the **full record** — every commitment made in the room, regardless of owner. The inbox is the operator's GTD surface only: their own actions, plus the rare delegated item that hard-blocks them.

> [!warning] Delegated ≠ the operator's inbox
> The single biggest source of inbox bloat is routing every `team` commitment into the operator's inbox. Don't. The operator does not track their team's task lists. A `team` item only reaches them when `blocks_operator: true` — and that goes to `waiting/`, not the inbox. When in genuine doubt about whether something blocks them, default to inline-only (false); a missed blocker resurfaces naturally, an over-eager inbox does not self-clean.

The `[REVIEW]` flood-guard cap (≤7 per session) applies to `[REVIEW]` proposals (uncertain inferences). It does NOT apply to `[ACTION]` items.

### 8. Verify outputs before completion

Verify every required meeting, decision, substantive entity update and routed commitment exists, cites the source, and agrees with the source. Check the planned output list against the actual files; a missing required update keeps the run incomplete. No-content sources use an explicit disposition instead of an invented meeting.

Run `bash config/scripts/check-wikilinks.sh --require-links <paths>` on every created/updated knowledge note. Run the checker separately without `--require-links` on the raw source. A plain-text source path is not a wikilink; a note with no outgoing wikilinks fails completion. Zero broken required references is necessary, but does not prove factual correctness. Review attendee attribution, ownership and uncertainty separately. Record source identity, output paths, verification result and any remaining work in a processing receipt in the existing session-log note (source ID/hash, output paths, verification, remaining work).

### 9. Mark complete, archive, and reconcile

Only after step 8 succeeds, set `processed: true` and populate `processed-into:` with the verified outputs. A no-content source must retain its explicit disposition and verification evidence even when it has no meeting output. Move an intake source to `system/transcripts/` without replacing an existing file; an existing destination is a reconciliation case, not permission to overwrite.

Verify the final source location and its output links after the move. A failed move or final check leaves the overall run incomplete. On retry, inspect both locations and that processing receipt, reuse verified outputs, and do only missing work. Never infer completion from an archive location alone or create a second commitment for the same source item.

### 10. Log

Hook fires `source-processed` and `object-created` events automatically. No manual log entry needed.

## Failure fallback

If `extract-transcript-gemini.sh` exits non-zero:

| Exit code | Cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Gemini API error (rate limit, malformed request, transient) | Retry once with a 5s backoff. If still failing, fall back to step 2. |
| 2 | Hard failure (auth, prompt/schema missing, transcript unreadable) | Stop. Surface the error. No fallback — the operator needs to fix infra. |
| 3 | Gemini output didn't parse as JSON | Retry once. If still failing, fall back to step 2. |

**Step 2 (Sonnet fallback):** Delegate to the `knowledge-management` subagent with `model: sonnet`. Subagent prompt MUST be self-contained per the existing delegation pattern (see § Delegation pattern below). Sonnet does the full synthesis the way the pre-Gemini skill did — slower and more expensive, but reliable.

**If Sonnet also fails:** Stop, surface to the operator. Do not silently downgrade further.

## Delegation pattern (when Gemini fallback fires, or for batch processing)

For long transcripts (≥500 utterances), batches of multiple transcripts, or when the operator wants to keep the main session light, delegate to a `knowledge-management` subagent with `model: sonnet`. Sonnet handles the extraction craft well at meaningfully lower cost than the main session's model.

The subagent prompt MUST be fully self-contained — it sees zero of the main session's context. Required elements:

1. **The intake file paths.**
2. **Operator-confirmed attendee list** (if known) — the actual people in the room, not just the calendar invitees.
3. **Calendar invitees who should NOT be treated as present** (e.g., a calendar-only invitee on a client design-group meeting).
4. **Existing person-note paths** for attendees, so the agent knows which wikilinks resolve.
5. **Client folder and active-project folder paths** for matching cross-updates.
6. **Rule files to read** — `config/objects/meeting.md`, `config/rules/source-processing-pattern.md`, `config/rules/matching.md`, `config/rules/no-fabrication.md`, `config/rules/double-entry-knowledge.md`, `config/rules/writing-style.md`, plus this skill.
7. **Known sensitive content** the meeting touches — so the agent sets `sensitive: true` proactively.
8. **Required output schema** — what files to produce, what files to update, what to move, what to verify with check-wikilinks.
9. **Final-report shape** — speaker resolution summary, files produced/updated, anything unexpected, open items.

The main session's role after dispatch: read both meeting notes end-to-end, spot-check matching, verify check-wikilinks ran clean.

### Parallel backlog mode

The delegation above runs **one** subagent at a time (or sequentially). When the backlog is large — **≥10 unprocessed transcripts, or explicit operator request** — fan out to multiple subagents in parallel. Parallel writers with no file locking means last-writer-wins clobbering is a real hazard, so this mode trades raw parallelism for a strict ownership boundary. Do NOT use it for the normal interactive one-at-a-time flow — that stays simple and same-pass.

**0. Extraction order is a hard sequence, stated per transcript.** Each parallel agent's prompt (or shared protocol file) must state the extraction order explicitly: attempt `extract-transcript-gemini.sh` first, retry once on failure, and only then fall back to direct synthesis — and must require the agent's manifest to report which path ran (`extraction: gemini | fallback`) so deviations are visible in review. Left implicit, agents read the fallback as optional-first and synthesize directly at roughly 5x the per-transcript cost (observed 2026-07-07: 1 of 10 agents skipped Gemini entirely).

**1. Partition into disjoint clusters.** Group the transcripts so no two clusters are expected to touch the same entity (e.g. all of one client's meetings in one cluster; each team member's 1:1s in their own cluster). Build a quick preflight entity map (Glob `atlas/people/*`, `atlas/clients/*`, `gtd/projects/*`) so the partition is grounded, not guessed.

**2. Ownership is a path denylist, not an entity inference.** Each parallel agent owns — and may write — only files **uniquely** produced by its cluster:
- its meeting notes (`atlas/meetings/{date}-{slug}.md`)
- its uniquely-named inbox/waiting items (`[ACTION]`/`[REVIEW]`/`[QUESTION]`/`[WAITING]`)
- standalone decision notes with unique slugs
- its own transcripts' frontmatter + the `mv` into `system/transcripts/` (after verification)

Everything else is **shared and off-limits while fanning out** — by path, regardless of whether the agent thinks it "owns" the entity (agents can be wrong about identity):
- any `atlas/clients/*/_status.md`, `atlas/businesses/*/_status.md`, `gtd/projects/*/_status.md`, any `_brief.md`
- any person note that more than one cluster could touch
- any shared index/state/log file

**3. Shared updates come back as durable findings — not chat.** A parallel agent NEVER edits a shared file. It writes each needed change as a structured finding to a durable file (e.g. `system/_processing/findings/{run-id}/{agent}-{n}.md`), not just its final report — if the consolidation step dies, chat-only findings are lost. Each finding carries: `target_path`, `entity`, `source_meeting`, `source_transcript`, `date`, `proposed_text`, `reason`, `confidence`. If an agent discovers a cross-cluster entity mid-run (the partition was wrong), it stops writing that shared file and emits a finding flagging the overlap.

**4. One sequential consolidation pass.** After ALL parallel agents finish, a single agent (or the main session) applies every finding — one file at a time, **chronological by source-meeting date per target file** (per [[../../rules/matching]] § Conflicting information), deduping findings that target the same file + same source + same claim, and preserving genuine conflicts with source attribution (create a `[QUESTION]` only when state is actually ambiguous). Make it **idempotent**: each applied addition carries its source wikilink, so a re-run skips what's already present. Then run `check-wikilinks.sh` on every touched file.

**5. Manifest + reconciliation — "moved" ≠ "done".** Each agent returns a per-transcript manifest (processed / files created / files moved / findings emitted / verification result). Before declaring the run complete, reconcile by scanning BOTH `system/intake/` and `system/transcripts/`: a transcript counts as done only when `processed: true`, `processed-into:` is populated, its meeting note exists, and check-wikilinks passed — not merely because it landed in the archive folder. An agent that died mid-cluster can leave a note written but not moved, or moved with an incomplete `processed-into:` — the reconciliation scan is what catches it; re-dispatch the stragglers.

## Confidentiality

If the meeting note carries `sensitive: true` (set by Gemini or by operator flag), apply confidentiality conventions per [[../../objects/meeting]] § Confidentiality:
- Internal traceability stays — meeting note links to transcript and people as usual
- Any content draft proposed from this meeting must anonymize identifying details
- Add a `[QUESTION]` if any insight is unusually identifiable and you're unsure whether it can be shared externally

**Sensitive transcripts still go through the Gemini extraction path.** The data is already in WorkDesk OS (a third-party indexable surface). Sending the verbatim to Gemini's API doesn't materially change the trust posture, and the cost/latency savings are real. If you want a "Gemini-bypass for sensitive content" gate, add it explicitly via operator instruction — don't infer it from `sensitive: true`.

## Cost reference

| Path | Cost per transcript | Latency | Quality |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite + Claude integration (default) | ~$0.05-$0.10 | ~10-30s | Validated on Google Meet + Granola test set; high on name-resolved, partial on diarization |
| Sonnet subagent (fallback) | ~$0.30-$0.50 | ~1-2 min | Reliable; less consistent on schema discipline |
| Opus in main session | ~$1-$2 | ~2-5 min | Highest quality; reserved for sensitive/high-stakes when manually invoked |

## What NOT to do

- **Don't fabricate attendees.** If Gemini returned a name not in the transcript, drop it. Per [[../../rules/no-fabrication]].
- **Don't treat the Granola/Google `attendees-from-source` field as ground truth.** That's the calendar invite list, not actual presence. Use Gemini's `attendees_present` (which is grounded in transcript speaker turns).
- **Don't fill timeline gaps.** If the transcript jumps topics, don't reconstruct what was missed.
- **Don't guess speaker names when Gemini returned `low` confidence.** Plain `Speaker X (unidentified)` + `[REVIEW]` beats fabrication.
- **Don't create person notes for clients' clients** (homeowners, prospects, tertiary mentions). Per [[../../objects/person]] network-scope filter.
- **Don't create inbox `[ACTION]` items for `client_team`, `client_client`, or non-blocking `team` commitments.** Per [[../../objects/action]] ownership filter and Gemini's owner_category enum. Only `operator` items create inbox `[ACTION]`s; blocking `team` items create a `waiting/` entry.
- **Don't apply the `[REVIEW]` flood-guard cap to `[ACTION]` items** — every operator commitment becomes its own file.
- **Don't process a transcript without operator confirmation in interactive mode.**
- **Don't synthesize from Gemini's Tab-1 Notes summary or any pre-baked summary** — the pipeline runs against the verbatim only. Per [[../../rules/source-processing-pattern]].
- **Don't move the transcript out of `system/intake/`** until every downstream artifact is produced AND verified clean.
- **Don't tweak `prompt.txt` or `schema.json` without re-testing.** Both live next to this file and are easy to iterate, but every change should be smoke-tested on at least one Granola + one Google Meet transcript before being treated as production.
