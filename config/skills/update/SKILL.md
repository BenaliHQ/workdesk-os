description: Pulls the latest WorkDesk OS release and applies it to this vault — updates skills, rules, scripts, and schema. Walks you through any conflicts in plain language. Operator data (personal/, atlas/, gtd/, intel/, system/) is never touched.
---

# /update

Updates the WorkDesk OS control plane (`config/`) to the latest release. Operator-facing skill — most users won't be technical, so Claude leads with plain-language narration. The bash engine (`config/scripts/migrate.sh`) owns invariants; this skill orchestrates the conversation.

## Boundaries

- **Updates only `config/`** — your skills, rules, hooks, scripts, and the operator-profile schema. Never touches `personal/`, `atlas/`, `gtd/`, `intel/`, or `system/`.
- **Schema migrations** may rewrite specific files inside `config/` (e.g. `operator-profile.md` frontmatter when fields are renamed). Each migration is a versioned, reviewable script shipped with the release.
- **Backup is automatic** before any write, at `<vault>/.workdesk-backups/<timestamp>/`. Restore via `/update restore <id>` or by running `config/scripts/migrate.sh restore <id>`.

## Phases

### 1. Check

Run:

```
config/scripts/migrate.sh check
```

This fetches the latest release from GitHub, verifies its SHA256, extracts it to a staging directory, and prints a plan as JSON to stdout.

Parse the JSON. Three top-level cases:

- `status: "up-to-date"` — tell the operator: "You're on the latest release (vX). Nothing to update." Done.
- `status: "update-available"` — continue to phase 2.
- Engine error — surface it plainly. Common causes: no network, GitHub rate limit, release tooling broken on the repo side.

### 2. Narrate the plan

The plan JSON contains:

```
{
  "current_version": "1.2.0",
  "new_version":     "1.3.0",
  "staging":         "/path/to/extracted",
  "migrations":      ["1.2.0-to-1.3.0-foo.sh"],
  "files": {
    "skills/daily-ops/SKILL.md": {"action": "clean-update"},
    ...
  }
}
```

Action values and their meaning:

| Action | What happened | Operator-facing summary |
|---|---|---|
| `no-op` | File matches new release already, or operator's edits don't conflict | (don't mention) |
| `clean-update` | New release changed this file; operator hadn't edited it | "Updated cleanly" |
| `add` | New file in the release | "New: <path>" |
| `conflict` | Both operator and release changed the same file | Walk one at a time in phase 3 |
| `removed-in-release` | Release removes this file; operator's copy stays | "No longer shipped: <path>" |
| `operator-deleted-changed` | Operator deleted; release changed | Treat as conflict in phase 3 |
| `operator-deleted-removed` | Operator deleted; release removed | (don't mention) |
| `operator-only` | Operator's custom file, not in release | (don't mention; preserved) |

Summarize like this — short, factual, one paragraph:

> WorkDesk OS v1.3.0 is available. This update modifies 4 skills, adds 1 new skill, and ships 1 schema migration (operator-profile field rename). 2 files have conflicts because you've customized them. Want to proceed?

Wait for a yes/no. No preamble dump of every file path. If they say no, exit cleanly.

### 3. Walk conflicts (one at a time)

For each `conflict` (and `operator-deleted-changed`):

1. Read the operator's current file: `config/<path>`
2. Read the release version: `<staging>/workdesk/<path>`
3. Read the prior baseline (what the operator started from): `config/defaults/<path>`
4. Diff in your head: what did the operator change, what did the release change, do they overlap?
5. Tell the operator in plain language. Example:
   > **`skills/daily-ops/SKILL.md`** — You customized the evening-review section to add a reading log. The new version changes the morning section to add a calendar check. These don't actually overlap. Three options:
   > 1. Keep yours (the new morning improvement is skipped)
   > 2. Take the update (your evening customization is archived)
   > 3. Let me merge them — I'll combine your evening edits with the new morning section and show you the result first
6. Wait for one of: `1`, `2`, `3`, `keep`, `take`, `merge` (or natural language). One question per turn.
7. If they pick **merge**:
   - Construct the merged file in your head, applying both sets of changes
   - Write it to `<vault>/.workdesk-migrate-tmp/merged-<sanitized-path>`
   - Show the operator a tight summary: "I'll combine X from yours with Y from the new version. Diff vs your current: +12 lines, -3 lines. Approve?"
   - On approval, record `{"resolution": "merged", "merged_path": "<full path>"}` in resolutions
8. If they pick **keep** / **mine**: record `{"resolution": "mine"}`
9. If they pick **take** / **theirs**: record `{"resolution": "theirs"}`

Build the resolutions object as you go. After all conflicts resolved, write to `<vault>/.workdesk-migrate-tmp/resolutions.json`:

```json
{
  "skills/daily-ops/SKILL.md": {"resolution": "merged", "merged_path": "/path/to/.workdesk-migrate-tmp/merged-skills-daily-ops-SKILL.md"},
  "skills/pobo/SKILL.md": {"resolution": "mine"}
}
```

### 4. Apply

Run:

```
config/scripts/migrate.sh apply <staging> <vault>/.workdesk-migrate-tmp/resolutions.json
```

Both paths come from the plan JSON (`staging`) and what you just wrote.

The engine:
1. Backs up `config/` to `<vault>/.workdesk-backups/<timestamp>/`
2. Applies each file per the plan + resolutions
3. Runs schema migrations in order (each one is `bash <script>` with `WORKDESK_VAULT` and `WORKDESK_WD` env vars)
4. Atomically swaps in the new `defaults/` snapshot
5. Bumps `VERSION` last
6. Prints a JSON result: `{"status":"applied","new_version":"1.3.0","backup_id":"2026-04-30-143022"}`

If the engine fails at any step, it auto-restores from the backup before exiting non-zero. Surface the error to the operator and suggest re-running once the cause is fixed.

### 4b. Sync Obsidian defaults

After the engine `apply` succeeds, copy the canonical `.obsidian/` files from the new release into the operator's vault. These are settings the core Obsidian plugins (Daily Notes, Templater) read on launch — without them, daily-note creation lands at vault root with no template.

For each file under `<staging>/workdesk/config/defaults/obsidian/` (relative path preserved):

1. Compute target path: `<vault>/.obsidian/<relative-path>` (strip the `config/defaults/obsidian/` prefix).
2. If the target's parent directory doesn't exist, create it.
3. Overwrite the target with the source file contents. These files are canonical settings, not operator preferences — no merge, no prompt.
4. Skip the `README.md` in `config/defaults/obsidian/` — it's documentation, not config.

This applies on the **next natural Obsidian launch** — no toggle, no restart prompt. Don't ask the operator to do anything. The launch happens whenever they next reboot, update Obsidian, or close and reopen the app normally.

If the operator says they want the change to take effect immediately in their current Obsidian session, point them at: `Settings → Core plugins → toggle "Daily notes" off, then on`. That re-reads the config without an app restart. But this is a rare ask — for most operators, "next launch" is fine.

### 5. Confirm and close

On success, tell the operator:

> Updated to v1.3.0. Backed up your prior state to `.workdesk-backups/2026-04-30-143022/` (you can run `/update restore 2026-04-30-143022` to roll back). Restart Claude Code so the new skills load.

Tell them to restart Claude Code — skills are loaded at session start. Without a restart, the new skill bodies won't be picked up.

## Restore subcommand

If the operator says something like "undo that update" or "go back to before the update":

```
config/scripts/migrate.sh restore <backup-id>
```

`<backup-id>` is the timestamp directory name under `<vault>/.workdesk-backups/`. List them with `ls <vault>/.workdesk-backups/` if needed.

## Voice and pacing

- Plain language. No jargon. "Skills" and "rules" are fine; "control plane," "merge base," and "manifest" are not.
- One question per turn during conflict resolution.
- No status dump. Summarize the plan in one paragraph; mention specific files only when they need a decision.
- If the operator says no at any prompt, stop cleanly — no follow-up nag.

## Failure recovery

If the apply phase fails:
- The engine has already restored from backup
- Tell the operator: "The update couldn't apply cleanly. I rolled back. The error was: [verbatim engine error]. Want me to retry, or hold off?"
- Do not retry automatically.

If `check` fails (network, rate limit):
- Tell the operator the cause in one sentence
- Suggest waiting and re-running

If migrations partially fail mid-stream, the engine restores `config/` from backup but does NOT undo schema-migration writes that already landed. This is rare (migrations are idempotent and tested in CI), but if it happens, surface the migration name and which file it last touched so the operator can review manually.
