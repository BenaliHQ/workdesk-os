name: daily-ops
description: Generate today's daily plan via the daily-plan signal, then surface session-entry items (unprocessed transcripts, intake, due signals). Run first thing in a session, or when context shifts mid-day. Updates state/signals.json after writing.

# /daily-ops

Daily operating cycle. Reads session-entry state, runs the daily-plan signal, surfaces what needs attention right now.

## Invocation

- `/daily-ops` — full cycle: read state, generate daily plan, surface inbox
- `/daily-ops --plan-only` — generate daily plan, skip surfacing
- `/daily-ops --refresh` — regenerate daily plan even if today's already exists

## Phases

### 1. Read session-entry state

Read `config/state/session-entry.md`. Note the counts:
- unprocessed transcripts
- intake items
- unsummarized session logs
- due signals

### 2. Run daily-plan signal

Follow `config/signals/daily-plan.md`:

1. Resolve anchors (today's calendar via `gws calendar +agenda --today` if enabled, today's daily note, active project `_status.md`, due recurring items, unread inbox)
2. Traverse:
   - For each person on today's calendar, fetch their atlas/people note + last meeting
   - For each project referenced today, fetch `_status` + recent meetings
   - Surface stale work where `today - last-touched > 1.5 × expected-cadence`
3. Apply sparse-data fallback chain (skip layers with no data)
4. Apply tonality from `operator-profile.role` and `operator-profile.work-mode`. If `first-30-days-mode: active`, lean toward setup-oriented framing; otherwise neutral. If either field is empty (early state), default to neutral.

Write to `intel/briefings/daily/{YYYY-MM-DD}-daily-plan.md` with the signal frontmatter:

```yaml
---
type: signal
shape: briefing
date: 2026-04-26
sources: ["..."]
schedule: daily
---
```

Body sections per the declaration:
1. Today's commitments + relevant context
2. Projects to advance + where you left off
3. Stalled items needing attention
4. Inbox items awaiting triage (with backlog warning if >20)

### 3. Surface

Print to chat (after the file is written):
- Top 3 commitments with one-line context each
- Top 3 advance-work items
- Inbox count + 1-line summary if backlog >20
- Unprocessed source counts and proposals (e.g., "3 transcripts unprocessed — run `/process-transcripts`?")

### 4. Update state

After successful write:
- `config/state/signals.json` → `daily-plan.last-fired` = today

If write fails, do NOT update state. `/workdesk-doctor` trusts output files over state.

## Auto-expiry side effect

Daily-plan also cleans up expired inbox items as a side effect:
- `[AWARENESS]` older than 7 days → archive to `gtd/inbox/_archive/{YYYY-MM}/`
- `[QUESTION]` older than 14 days → archive

`[REVIEW]` and `[ACTION]` never expire — operator clears.

## What NOT to do

- Don't generate a hollow plan. If all 7 fallback layers return empty, produce a setup-oriented plan, not a stub.
- Don't write past the cap (7 new `[REVIEW]` per session). Batch beyond that.
- Don't update state before the file is written.
- Don't write to `personal/`. Read today's daily note; never modify it.
