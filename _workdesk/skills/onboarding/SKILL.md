description: Five-phase calm orientation for a freshly bootstrapped vault. Silent doctor self-check, welcome, operator-profile interview, brief zone tour, then graduate by either planning a real project with /pobo or starting today's daily note. One question per turn. Idempotent and resumable. Sub-commands --status, --restart, --update-profile.

# /onboarding

Calm, concierge-style first-run experience. Five phases. One question per turn. Each phase writes results as it goes — if interrupted, partial work is preserved and resuming picks up at the first non-`complete` phase.

Source spec: `atlas/projects/workdesk/specs/onboarding-redesign.md` (in the operator's secondary vault — that's the design contract this skill implements).

## Sub-commands

- `/onboarding` — resume from incomplete phase, or run full flow first time
- `/onboarding --status` — show what's been configured
- `/onboarding --restart` — wipe `_workdesk/onboarding-state.md` with confirmation; vault content untouched
- `/onboarding --update-profile` — interactive profile edit (post-graduation safe)

## Detection

Run proactively when:
- `_workdesk/onboarding-state.md` exists with any phase still `pending` or `incomplete`
- AND operator has not dismissed onboarding this session

Confirmation guard: running `/onboarding` after graduation says: *"Onboarding complete. Use `--restart` to redo it (vault content is safe), or `--update-profile` to adjust your profile."*

## Scope — workdesk skills only

The only skills that exist for this session are those under `<vault>/_workdesk/skills/*/SKILL.md`. That is the closed universe.

When listing, proposing, suggesting, resolving, or invoking a skill name during onboarding, enumerate **only** the `_workdesk/skills/` directory of the active vault. Do not surface, mention, or auto-invoke:

- skills installed at `~/.claude/skills/` (user-level)
- skills from sibling projects' `.claude/skills/` directories
- skills loaded by other vaults that share the same Claude Code environment
- tools surfaced by MCP servers as if they were skills
- plugin-provided skills outside the workdesk plugin set

If the operator references a skill by name (e.g., "/foo"), resolve it against `_workdesk/skills/` only. If no match, reply: "That's not a WorkDesk skill. The WorkDesk skills are: [list from `_workdesk/skills/`]." Do not silently fall through to a same-named skill from another scope.

## Style — pacing and tone

This is a guided conversation, not a form. Hard rules:

- **One question per turn.** Ask one thing, wait for the answer, then ask the next. Never stack two questions in one message.
- **Snappy.** Short sentences. Plain words. No bureaucratic preambles ("I need your input here", "Question 1 —", baseline-state dumps).
- **Frame each phase in one line before the first question.** Not three paragraphs. One line. Then the question.
- **Back-and-forth pace.** Treat it like a chat with someone next to you, not a wizard form.
- **Do not pre-fill answers from external context.** If you can see the operator's name or context from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, env vars, vault path, or git config — ignore it for the purpose of asking. Ask fresh. Operators tell you if they want to short-circuit ("yeah, that's me"). Inferring up front feels presumptuous.
- **No baseline-state dumps before questions.** Don't list what's already in `atlas/` or what doctor returned before asking the next question. The operator doesn't need a status report; they need the next step.
- **Examples are illustrative, not options.** When a question lists examples (roles, tools, etc.), the operator can answer with anything — not just the listed ones. Treat examples as prompts for thought, not a closed multiple-choice.

## Phases

### Phase 0 — Doctor (silent)

**Purpose:** prove the install works without asking the operator to do anything.

Onboarding owns its own prerequisite. Do not bounce the operator out to run a separate command.

Read `_workdesk/state/doctor.md`. If `result: pass` is present and `last-run` is within the current session, continue silently. Otherwise:

1. Invoke `/workdesk-doctor` inline (as a skill call from within onboarding). Wait for it to complete.
2. Re-read `_workdesk/state/doctor.md`.
3. **Pass** → continue silently to Phase 1.
4. **Yellow** (fixable issues) → attempt minimal self-fix: chmod missing exec bits on `_workdesk/scripts/*.sh`, recreate broken state files from defaults, repair direct-symlink mismatches. Re-run doctor. If now green, continue silently.
5. **Red** (unfixable) → surface a single concise message naming what failed and stop. Do not list options or open a menu.

**Self-fix scope (V1.1):** chmod, recreate state files, repair symlinks. Out of scope: reinstalling plugins, reauth, anything that requires the operator to leave the chat.

**No operator prompt at this phase.** No "running doctor now…" status messages. Silent unless something's red.

Mark phase 0 complete in `_workdesk/onboarding-state.md`.

### Phase 1 — Welcome

**Purpose:** orient. Set expectations. Land the concierge tone.

**Pre-step (silent):** if `<vault>/README.md` does not exist, write the vault-root README from the template at `<vault>/_workdesk/templates/vault-readme.md`. Do not overwrite an existing README — operators who customized theirs keep their version.

**Opening message** (single short paragraph, exact text):

> *"Let's get your WorkDesk set up. Five quick steps — environment check (done), a few questions about you, a quick tour of your vault, and then we'll either plan a project together or start today's daily note. I'll go one thing at a time. You can bail anytime — we pick up where we left off. Sound good?"*

Wait for affirmative. If declined: *"Run `/onboarding` whenever you're ready."* Stop.

Mark phase 1 complete.

### Phase 2 — Operator profile interview

**Purpose:** build the operator profile that downstream skills read. One question per turn. Never stack.

After each answer, write to `_workdesk/operator-profile.md` immediately, then ask the next question.

**Q1 — name:**

> *"First — what should I call you?"*

Free text. Save to `name:`. Do not pull a name from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, vault path, git config, or anywhere else.

**Q2 — role (open-ended):**

> *"How would you describe what you do? Examples — consultant, founder, employee, researcher, creative, parent, or anything else. There are no preset options; describe it the way you'd describe it to someone you just met."*

Free text. Examples are illustrative. Operator can answer however they like — coerce nothing. Save verbatim to `role:`.

**Q3 — work mode:**

> *"What does most of your work look like? Heavy meetings, heavy deep-work, mixed, or something else?"*

Free text. Save to `work-mode:`.

**Q4 — areas of focus (durable):**

> *"What are the areas you focus on most — generally, not just right now? Could be domains (finance, ops, design), topics, or kinds of work. Two or three is plenty."*

Parse into a list. Save under `## Areas of focus` in the profile body. Deliberately durable, not point-in-time priorities.

**Q5 — tools you use today (inventory only, no connection):**

Send a single message that names categories with several examples each, then asks the operator's list:

> *"What tools do you use day-to-day? Just naming them helps me know what's in your stack — I won't connect anything until you actually need it. Some categories and examples:*
>
> - *Comms — Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord*
> - *Email + calendar — Gmail / Google Workspace, Outlook*
> - *Meetings + transcription — Granola, Google Meet, Zoom, Teams, Otter, Fireflies*
> - *Project management — ClickUp, Notion, Asana, Linear, Trello*
> - *CRM — HubSpot, Salesforce, Apollo, Pipedrive*
> - *Storage — Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, iCloud*
> - *Design — Figma, Canva*
> - *Code + deploy — GitHub, GitLab, Vercel, Netlify*
> - *Finance — QuickBooks, Xero*
>
> *Tell me whichever you use — and anything else not on the list."*

For each named tool:

1. Slugify the name (lowercase, kebab-case).
2. If `_workdesk/tools/<slug>.md` already exists (seeded), set `confirmed-by-operator: true` on its frontmatter. Do **not** overwrite content.
3. If absent, create `_workdesk/tools/<slug>.md` with frontmatter (`tool:`, `slug:`, `category:` inferred from context, `class: operator-named`, `connected: false`, `added-on:` today, `connector: unknown`) and stub body sections (`## What it is`, `## Best practices`, `## Connection notes`, `## Linked use cases`).

Update the profile body's `## Tools in use` section with wikilinks to each tool note.

**Q6 — transcription sources (multiple allowed):**

> *"Of those, which do you actually use to capture meetings? You can name more than one — Granola for some meetings, Zoom for others, etc."*

For each named tool, append `transcription` to its `preferred-for:` list on the corresponding `_workdesk/tools/<slug>.md`. Multiple is normal.

If "none" or "skip," continue. Transcript-processing skill's first-run will handle wiring later.

Mark phase 2 complete.

### Phase 3 — Zone tour (5 short turns)

**Purpose:** name each zone and how to add to it. Briefly. Tutorial videos handle depth.

One zone per turn, in this order. Each turn is **three sentences max:** what it's for, how the operator adds to it, no preamble. No "Phase 3:" prefix on the messages — just the zone content.

After Phase 2 completes, send the first zone message. Operator doesn't need to respond between zones; you can send them as a back-to-back sequence with a brief pause for them to read. If they ask a question mid-tour, answer briefly and continue.

**3a — `personal/`:**

> *"`personal/` is your space — daily notes, journal, reading, anything you write. Claude or any other agent never writes in `personal/`, and you should never want me to. You'll add to it most by running your daily note."*

The lock language is deliberate. Do not soften it to "unless you ask." The PreToolUse hook enforces the boundary at runtime; this teaches it conceptually.

**3b — `atlas/`:**

> *"`atlas/` is what you manage — people, decisions, meetings. When something has its own identity worth tracking, it goes here."*

**3c — `GTD/`:**

> *"`GTD/` is for actions and projects — standard getting-things-done shape, like David Allen recommends."*

**3d — `intel/`:**

> *"`intel/` is what I observe — daily briefings, research, vault improvements. Lower trust than `atlas/` because I write it independently."*

**3e — `system/`:**

> *"`system/` is your sources — transcripts, bookmarks, session logs. Everything that comes in lands in `_intake/` first, gets processed, and once processed moves to the right folder. Objects in `atlas/` get updated or created from there."*

**Closing line** (after 3e):

> *"All five tutorial videos live in your vault README — open it whenever you want to rewatch."*

Mark phase 3 complete.

### Phase 4 — Graduation (the fork)

**Purpose:** the operator does one real thing. Right now, not tomorrow.

**Opening message:**

> *"You're set up. Two ways to wrap: I can walk you through planning a project with `/pobo`, or we can just open today's daily note so you can start writing. Either's fine. Which?"*

Wait for choice.

**Path A — `/pobo` a project:**

If operator picks pobo:
1. Mark phase 4 in-progress with `path: pobo` in `_workdesk/onboarding-state.md`.
2. Invoke `/pobo` (skill call from within onboarding). Pobo runs its planning ritual and produces a real project structure at `gtd/projects/<slug>/`.
3. When pobo completes, return to onboarding to finalize graduation.

**Path B — daily note:**

If operator picks daily note:
1. Mark phase 4 in-progress with `path: daily-note`.
2. Create `personal/daily/{today}.md` from the template at `<vault>/_workdesk/templates/daily-note.md`. Substitute `{today}` with ISO date.
3. Open the file in Obsidian via URI scheme: `obsidian://open?vault=<vault-name>&file=personal/daily/{today}`. If the URI launch fails (e.g., Obsidian not focused, terminal can't `open` URLs), fall back to printing the path and instructing the operator to click it in the file tree.

**Either path: graduation marker.**

After the chosen path completes, update:
- `_workdesk/onboarding-state.md` phase 4 `complete: true`, `graduated: true`, `graduated-at: <iso-timestamp>`, `graduation-path: pobo|daily-note`
- `_workdesk/state/signals.json` `vault-improvements.suppressed-until: <today + 14d>`

**Final summary** (two lines, no decoration):

```
Profile saved at _workdesk/operator-profile.md.
Tools tracked: <count>. Wire any with /define-tool <name> when you need them.
```

Do not point the operator at `/daily-ops`, `/weekly-review`, or any other follow-up skill at the close. They'll discover skills when they're ready — that's the whole point of the skill-first-run pattern.

Mark phase 4 complete.

## Output

After graduation:
- `_workdesk/operator-profile.md` populated
- `_workdesk/tools/<slug>.md` per named tool (seeded notes confirmed, operator-named notes created)
- `<vault>/README.md` materialized (if not pre-existing)
- One real artifact: either a project under `gtd/projects/` (Path A) or today's daily note under `personal/daily/` (Path B)
- `_workdesk/onboarding-state.md` shows `graduated: true`
- Vault-improvement suppression set 14 days out

## What NOT to do

- Don't skip Phase 0. Doctor must self-run and self-fix. Never instruct the operator to run a separate command before continuing.
- Don't write to `personal/` except the templated daily-note creation in Phase 4 Path B (the only sanctioned write).
- Don't fabricate contexts or pre-fill answers from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, env vars, vault path, or git config. Ask fresh.
- Don't stack questions. One question per turn, period.
- Don't dump baseline state ("atlas/ has X, Y, Z. Doctor green.") between turns.
- Don't invoke `/daily-ops` or `/weekly-review` during the flow. Don't reference them at graduation either — no "tomorrow run X" pointers, no skill catalog. The operator discovers downstream skills when they're ready.
- Don't surface or invoke skills outside `_workdesk/skills/`. No `ops-manager`, no sibling-project leakage, no MCP-surfaced tools as skills.
- Don't prompt for MCP / API integration setup. Phase 2 Q5 is inventory only; connection deferred to `/define-tool`.
- Don't ask for *lists* of things the operator might balk at. Ask for one (one project name, one tool category at a time when probing). Lists trigger overwhelm.
- Don't introduce a concept before the operator touches the artifact it names. Zones get named in Phase 3 because that's when it's time; no glossary up front.
- Don't enumerate the WorkDesk skill catalog at graduation. Don't name a "first habit" either. Graduation confirms what just happened; the operator drives what comes next.
- Don't gate Phase 4 on prior skips. Even if Phase 2 was skipped halfway, the operator can still choose pobo or daily-note.
- Don't coerce free-text answers (role, work-mode, areas) into preset categories. Examples are illustrative, not multiple-choice.
